# Data-Lineage
UCLA- 259 - Research paper

"Data lineage is defined as a data life cycle that includes the data’s origins and where it moves over time.”  It describes 
what happens to data as it goes through diverse processes. It helps provide visibility into the analytics pipeline and 
simplifies tracing errors back to their sources. It also enables replaying specific portions or inputs of the dataflow 
for step-wise debugging or regenerating lost output. In fact, database systems have used such information, called data 
provenance, to address similar validation and debugging challenges already
